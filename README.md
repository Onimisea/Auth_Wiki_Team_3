# A repository for the collaborative work by Team 3 on the Auth Wiki Project
commit changes with "git add file_name"

Project have been setup with few settings in settings.py.

Two apps have been created: User Auth - where I am working and Library - where the rest of you will be working.

I am still working on the user_auth app and I urge you not to tamper with it.

The library app is where most of you will be working most of the time.

Static and Template folders have been set up. Should you decide to create new apps, also create folders for your apps inside the static and template folders.
